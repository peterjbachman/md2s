Just a testing file for git 
Use git branch to create a new branch.
For example:
$ git branch Cecilia

Then use git checkout to work on that branch 
$ git checkout Cecilia 

A shorthand for the two commands above :
$ git checkout -b Cecilia


If you run git branch, it tells you which branch you are on 
$ git branch 

Please make sure to commit ONLY to your own branch!
Do NOT make commits to the main branch without letting the group know beforehand. Thank you!
