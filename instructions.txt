The tasks:

1. Create the help files for the MD2S function

2. Create a permutation test based for the results of MD2S, when fixing the number of dimensions to d. Goal: we want to distinguish how many dimensions out of d are different from noise. Sample code for this: Figure_03/01_Create_Data_Panel_A.R (look for the loop that does the shuffling and compares the observed loadings to the loadings that come from noise)

3. Create a help file for the function in 2

4. We will create test code to check that given the sample data for the R-package, the functions in 1 and 2 do not break when modified

5. We will take inspiration in the github repo for the following package for our github repo:
