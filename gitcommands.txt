Just a testing file for git 
Use git branch to create a new branch.
For example:
$ git branch Cecilia

Then use git checkout to work on that branch 
$ git checkout Cecilia 

A shorthand for the two commands above :
$ git checkout -b Cecilia


If you run git branch, it tells you which branch you are on 
$ git branch 
Then terminal will tell you: 
* Cecilia
  main


You can use the git commands learned in R class to make commits locally, then push to the remote repo. 
First, run git add to add the changes  
$ git add *

Then, use git commit 
$ git commit -m "better if you can add some meaningful messages" 

Then, use git push to push the changes to your remote repo  
$ git push 

Once you have done these three steps, you can open up the repo (https://github.com/peterjbachman/md2s/tree/main) in a browser and view the changes. 
Remember to switch to your own branch. 


Please make sure to commit ONLY to your own branch when working on the code. 
Do NOT make commits or push to the main branch without letting the group know beforehand.
We will do the merges together as a group.Thank you!
